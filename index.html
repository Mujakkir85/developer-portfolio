            <h3>Web Development Best Practices</h3>
            <p>From simple machines to smartphones, it’s no secret that technology is becoming increasingly necessary in
                our everyday lives. Websites are a key component of any business, and every website or app that we come
                across is created by a web developer.Even the tools that allow non-developers to design easy websites
                (like WordPress or Wix,those drag-and-drop systems much loved by anyone who can’t find their way around
                a line ofHTML) are created by web developers. So as you can imagine, the need for web developers is
                high.
